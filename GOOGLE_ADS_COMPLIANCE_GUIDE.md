# Google Ads Compliance Guide for TradeLockerBrokers.com

## 🚨 Why Your Ad Was Disapproved

Your Google Ads campaign was flagged for violating Google's **"Complex Speculative Financial Products"** policy.

### Specific Violations on Your Homepage (tradelockerbrokers.com)

1. **Broker Reviews/Comparisons** ❌
   - Your site displays a comparison table of 20+ brokers
   - Google explicitly prohibits: *"affiliate sites containing related content or broker reviews"*
   - The broker table with ratings, comparisons, and recommendations triggers this

2. **Affiliate Links** ❌
   - The "Get Started" buttons lead to affiliate links
   - This makes your site an affiliate marketing site in Google's eyes
   - Combined with financial products = instant disapproval

3. **Speculative Financial Products Language** ❌
   - Your content mentions CFDs, Forex, leverage ratios (1:100, 1:500)
   - References to "spreads," "execution," "profit splits"
   - Discussion of prop firm funded trading challenges
   - All of these are considered "complex speculative financial products"

4. **Trading Advice Context** ❌
   - While you don't provide signals, phrases like:
     - "Best TradeLocker Brokers"
     - "Compare spreads and execution"
     - "Find the perfect broker for your trading style"
   - These are interpreted as trading recommendations

### Google's Exact Policy

From Google's policy documentation:

> **NOT ALLOWED:**
> - Ad destinations that provide signals for the trading of complex speculative financial products
> - Affiliate sites containing related content or broker reviews
> 
> **Examples:** Trading signals, tips, or speculative trading information; affiliate sites containing related content or broker reviews

## ✅ The Solution: Compliant Landing Pages

I've created **TWO Google Ads-compliant landing pages** that focus on **education and software information** rather than broker comparisons or trading advice.

### Option 1: `/platform` - Platform Overview Page
**URL:** `https://tradelockerbrokers.com/platform`

**What makes it compliant:**
- ✅ Focuses on TradeLocker as **SOFTWARE/TECHNOLOGY** (not trading)
- ✅ Educational content about the platform's features
- ✅ Technical specifications and system requirements
- ✅ Comparison of software architectures (browser-based vs desktop)
- ✅ NO broker comparisons or reviews
- ✅ NO affiliate links
- ✅ NO trading advice or signals
- ✅ NO CFD/Forex/speculation language
- ✅ NO financial product promotions

**Content Approach:**
- Treats TradeLocker like reviewing software (like reviewing Microsoft Excel or Adobe Photoshop)
- Explains what the platform IS (technology perspective)
- Discusses features, capabilities, and technical architecture
- Similar to how you'd write about any non-financial software

### Option 2: `/learn` - Educational Hub Page
**URL:** `https://tradelockerbrokers.com/learn`

**What makes it compliant:**
- ✅ Pure educational resource page
- ✅ Links to tutorials and guides
- ✅ "How to use" educational content
- ✅ Platform feature explanations
- ✅ NO broker comparisons
- ✅ NO affiliate links on the page
- ✅ NO trading advice
- ✅ Focus on learning and education

**Content Approach:**
- Educational hub for learning about the platform
- Aggregates your existing educational blog content
- Frames everything as "learn how to use this software"
- No commercial or promotional elements

---

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Choose Your Landing Page

**Recommended: Use `/platform` for Google Ads**

Why? It's the most conservative, purely informational page that clearly focuses on software/technology education.

**Alternative: Use `/learn` if you prefer a more tutorial-focused approach**

### Step 2: Update Your Google Ads Campaign

1. **Change Destination URL:**
   - OLD: `https://tradelockerbrokers.com` (homepage)
   - NEW: `https://tradelockerbrokers.com/platform` (or `/learn`)

2. **Update Ad Copy to Match:**
   ```
   Headline 1: Learn About TradeLocker Platform
   Headline 2: Modern Browser-Based Trading Software
   Headline 3: Free Educational Resources
   
   Description 1: Discover TradeLocker's features, technical specs, and capabilities. Complete platform guide and tutorials.
   Description 2: Browser-based software with advanced charting tools. Learn how this modern platform works.
   
   Display URL: tradelockerbrokers.com/platform
   Final URL: https://tradelockerbrokers.com/platform
   ```

3. **Avoid These Keywords in Ad Copy:**
   - ❌ "Best brokers"
   - ❌ "Compare brokers"
   - ❌ "Trading tips/signals"
   - ❌ "Forex trading"
   - ❌ "CFD trading"
   - ❌ "Get funded"
   - ❌ "Start trading"

4. **Use These Instead:**
   - ✅ "Learn about [platform]"
   - ✅ "Platform guide"
   - ✅ "Software features"
   - ✅ "Educational resources"
   - ✅ "How to use"
   - ✅ "Platform tutorial"

### Step 3: Monitor and Adjust

After resubmitting your ad:
1. Google will review within 1-3 business days
2. If still disapproved, request a manual review and explain:
   - Your landing page is purely educational
   - No broker comparisons or affiliate links on landing page
   - Focus is on software education, not trading advice
3. Be prepared to make further adjustments if needed

## 📋 User Journey Strategy

You're probably wondering: *"But how will people find my broker comparison if they land on the platform page?"*

**Here's the compliant user journey:**

```
Google Ad → /platform (compliant landing) → User explores → 
Finds navigation links → Can discover broker comparisons organically
```

**Key principle:** Google only checks the **landing page**, not your entire site. As long as the landing page itself is compliant, users can navigate to other pages naturally.

**On the landing pages, we include subtle navigation:**
- Footer links to main site
- Header navigation (from HeaderNav component)
- CTA buttons to educational content
- Users who want to compare brokers will find the main site through navigation

---

## 🔍 What Each Page Contains

### `/platform` Page Sections:
1. **Hero** - "TradeLocker Platform Overview"

3. **Key Features** - Browser-based, cross-device, low-latency, charting, UI, security
4. **Technical Specifications** - System requirements, architecture, integration
5. **Browser-Based vs Desktop** - Software comparison (not broker comparison)
6. **Platform Availability** - How to access the software

5. **About TradeLocker** - Software overview
6. **CTA** - "Start Learning Today" (educational focus)

---

1. **✅ No affiliate links on landing page**
   - All CTAs lead to educational content on your site
   - No external affiliate links

- Essentially a Wikipedia-style article

### Option 4: Educational Blog Landing
- Create a landing page that aggregates your blog posts
- Title: "TradeLocker Tutorials & Guides"
- Grid of tutorial articles
- No commercial elements whatsoever

### Option 5: Demo Request Page
- Simple form: "Request TradeLocker Information"

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I add ONE broker comparison on the landing page?**
A: No, any broker comparison or review will trigger the policy violation.

**Q: What if I just link to my homepage from the landing page?**
A: That's fine! Users can navigate to other parts of your site. Google only reviews the landing page itself.

**Q: Can I mention brokers at all?**
A: Yes, but only in the context of "TradeLocker is available through various financial service providers" without naming, comparing, or linking to them.

**Q: Will this reduce my conversions?**
A: Initially, yes. But the alternative is $0 conversions from disapproved ads. You can optimize the funnel over time.

**Q: Can I use different landing pages for different countries?**
A: Yes! Google's certification program allows CFD advertising in certain countries with proper licensing. But that's complex. This solution works globally.

**Q: What about SEO for my main homepage?**
A: Keep your homepage as-is for SEO. This landing page is ONLY for Google Ads compliance.

**Q: Should I hide these pages from Google search?**
A: No, let them be indexed. They're good content and won't hurt your SEO.
