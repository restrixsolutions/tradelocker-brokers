## About RestroFX

### Company Background

RestroFX launched in 2022 with a clear mission: create the ultimate trading environment for prop firm traders. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, they focused exclusively on what funded traders need most - reliable execution, transparent pricing, and seamless integration with popular prop firms.

**Key Facts:**
- **Regulation:** Licensed and regulated
- **Founded:** 2022
- **Platform:** TradeLocker (primary focus)
- **Instruments:** Forex, Indices, Commodities
- **Minimum Deposit:** $250
- **Specialty:** Prop firm trading, funded accounts

### Why RestroFX Was Built

The founders recognized a gap in the market: prop firm traders needed brokers that understood their unique challenges - strict drawdown rules, profit targets, consistency requirements. RestroFX built their infrastructure specifically to meet these needs.

### Regulation & Safety

RestroFX operates under proper international licensing with comprehensive safety measures:

**Safety Features:**
- Client funds in segregated accounts
- Tier-1 banking partners
- Negative balance protection
- Transparent fee structure
- Regular compliance audits
- No conflicts of interest with prop firms

## TradeLocker Integration for Prop Trading

### Why TradeLocker Matters for Prop Firms

Most prop firms have migrated to TradeLocker for good reasons:
- Real-time risk monitoring
- Accurate profit/loss tracking
- Clean execution records
- No slippage manipulation
- Transparent trade history

RestroFX's TradeLocker implementation is optimized specifically for these requirements.

### Platform Performance

**Execution Metrics:**

- **Slippage:** Minimal and documented
- **Rejections:** Under 0.2%
- **Data Feed Quality:** Institutional-grade

**What Makes It Different:**
RestroFX prioritizes **consistency** over raw speed. Their 55ms execution might not be the fastest, but it's remarkably consistent - crucial when every tick matters in a funded challenge.
