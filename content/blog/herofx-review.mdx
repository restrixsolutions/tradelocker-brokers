## Gold Trading Performance

### Why Traders Choose HeroFX for Gold

HeroFX has become synonymous with reliable gold trading. Here's why:

**1. Consistent Spreads**
Unlike brokers that widen spreads dramatically during London open or news events, HeroFX maintains relatively stable spreads on gold throughout the trading day.

**2. Fast Fills During Volatility**
We tested order execution during major economic releases (NFP, CPI, FOMC). HeroFX filled orders consistently with minimal slippage.

**3. No Sudden Disconnections**
Platform stability during volatile gold moves is exceptional. No mysterious "connection lost" errors during sharp price movements.

**4. Good Leverage Options**
1:200 leverage on gold (compared to 1:100 or less at many brokers) provides flexibility for position sizing.

### Gold Trading Tips with HeroFX

- Use ECN or Pro account for active trading (spreads matter on gold)
