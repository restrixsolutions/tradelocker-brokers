This is a game-changer for traders who have been waiting for more convenient deposit options from this FSCA-regulated TradeLocker broker.

## What's New with GatesFX Card Deposits?

GatesFX has officially launched card payment support, giving traders a faster alternative to traditional bank transfers and crypto deposits. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Features
