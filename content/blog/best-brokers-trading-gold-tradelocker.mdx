## Gold Trading Strategies on TradeLocker

### Strategy 1: Trend Following (Most Profitable)

### Strategy 2: Scalping Support/Resistance (High Frequency)

**Setup:**

- Switch to 5-minute chart for entries
- Look for rejections at these levels

**Entry Rules:**
- Price touches major S/R level
- 5-minute candle shows rejection (long wick)

- Or wait for initial spike, then trade retracement

**Method 1: Breakout (Risky)**
- Place buy stop 20 pips above current price
- Place sell stop 20 pips below current price
- Let news trigger one order
- Tight 15-20 pip stop, 40-60 pip target

**Method 2: Retracement (Safer)**
- Wait for initial news spike (don't trade it)
- Identify new support/resistance
- Trade the pullback with tight stops

**Risk Management:**
- Widen stops during news (20-30 pips minimum)

**Key News Events for Gold:**

- Confirm with oscillators (RSI, Stochastic overbought/oversold)

**Risk Management:**
- Stop loss: Just outside range (15-20 pips)
- Take profit: Opposite side of range
- Exit if range breaks (don't fight breakouts)

**Best During:** Asian session, pre-London open
**Win Rate:** 65-75% (reliable in proper conditions)

**Setup:**
- Gold typically inversely correlated with USD (when USD up, gold down)
- Monitor DXY (US Dollar Index)
- Trade gold based on DXY movements

**Entry Rules:**
- DXY breaks major support → Long gold
- DXY breaks major resistance → Short gold
- Confirm with gold chart setup

**Example:**
- DXY breaks below 103.00 support (major level)
- Gold simultaneously tests resistance at $2,040
- Enter long gold at $2,041 (confluence)
- Stop: $2,025, Target: $2,065

**Win Rate:** 60-70% when correlation strong

## Gold Trading Risk Management

### Position Sizing for Gold

Gold's volatility requires careful position sizing:

**Conservative Approach (Recommended for Beginners):**
- Risk 1% of account per trade
- Stop loss: 30-40 pips
- Account size: $5,000

**Calculation:**
- $5,000 × 1% = $50 maximum risk
- 30-pip stop loss
- Position size: $50 ÷ 30 pips ÷ $1/pip = 1.67 micro lots
- Round down to 1.5 micro lots (0.015 lots)

**Moderate Approach (Experienced Traders):**
- Risk 2% of account per trade
- Stop loss: 25-35 pips
- Account size: $10,000

**Calculation:**
- $10,000 × 2% = $200 maximum risk
- 30-pip stop loss
- Position size: $200 ÷ 30 pips ÷ $1/pip = 6.67 micro lots
- Round down to 6.5 micro lots (0.065 lots)

**Aggressive Approach (Professionals Only):**
- Risk 3-5% per trade (only with proven edge)
- Tighter stops (15-25 pips)
- Larger accounts ($25,000+)

### Stop Loss Placement

**Technical Stop Loss:**
- Below/above recent swing low/high
- Outside consolidation ranges
- Beyond key support/resistance levels

**Volatility-Based Stop Loss:**
- Use ATR (Average True Range)
- Gold ATR typically 150-250 pips (daily)
- Stop loss = 0.5 to 1.0 × ATR from entry

**Example:**
- Gold ATR = 200 pips
- Entry: $2,045
- Stop loss: $2,045 - (200 × 0.5 ÷ 100) = $2,035 (10 pips)

**Time-Based Stop Loss:**
- Exit if trade hasn't moved in your direction after X hours
- Gold trades should show profit within 2-4 hours (day trading)
- If consolidating, exit and re-enter with better setup

### Common Gold Trading Mistakes

**1. Overleveraging**
Gold's volatility can wipe out accounts quickly. A 100-pip adverse move = $100 loss on 0.1 lot = 10% of $1,000 account.

**Solution:** Never risk more than 2% per trade, use smaller position sizes.

**2. Ignoring News Calendar**
Gold spikes $10-20 during major news. Being in a trade without knowing news is coming = disaster.

**Solution:** Check economic calendar every morning. Close or hedge positions before high-impact news if uncertain.

**3. Trading Asian Session**
Wide spreads + low liquidity = poor risk/reward.

**Solution:** Trade London and NY sessions unless specifically range trading.

**4. Fighting the Trend**
Gold trends strongly. Counter-trend trading has low win rate.

**Solution:** "Trade with the trend" or wait for clear reversal signals.

**5. Tight Stops in Volatile Markets**
Gold can spike 30-50 pips during news, then continue in your direction. Tight stops = stopped out before profit.

**Solution:** Wider stops during news (30-40 pips minimum), smaller position size to compensate.

## Leverage Considerations for Gold Trading

### Optimal Leverage for Gold

**Recommendation:** Use 1:100 to 1:200 leverage for gold, even if broker offers 1:500.

**Why Lower Leverage is Safer:**
- Gold's volatility creates large pip movements
- High leverage amplifies both gains and losses
- Margin calls happen faster with high leverage

**Example:**

**Scenario A: 1:500 Leverage**
- Account: $1,000
- Position: 1.0 lot (0.1 standard lots = $10/pip)
- Required margin: $40
- 50-pip adverse move = $500 loss (50% of account)
- 100-pip adverse move = margin call

**Scenario B: 1:100 Leverage**
- Account: $1,000
- Position: 0.2 lots ($2/pip)
- Required margin: $200
- 50-pip adverse move = $100 loss (10% of account)
- Much safer

### Leverage by Account Size

| Account Size | Recommended Leverage | Max Position (XAUUSD) | Max Risk Per Trade |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| $500-$1,000 | 1:100 | 0.05-0.1 lots | 1% ($5-10) |
| $1,000-$5,000 | 1:100-1:200 | 0.1-0.5 lots | 1-2% ($10-100) |
| $5,000-$10,000 | 1:200-1:300 | 0.5-1.0 lots | 2% ($100-200) |
| $10,000+ | 1:200-1:500 | 1.0+ lots | 2% ($200+) |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the tightest gold spreads on TradeLocker?

GatesFX offers the tightest gold spreads on TradeLocker at 0.15-0.2 pips on ECN/VIP accounts during liquid hours (London/NY overlap). This makes it ideal for gold scalpers where every 0.1 pip matters. Standard accounts typically have 2.0 pip spreads.

### When is the best time to trade gold?

The best time to trade gold is during the London/NY overlap (13:00-17:00 GMT) when liquidity is highest, spreads are tightest (0.2 pips), and major US economic data is released. Avoid Asian session (23:00-07:00 GMT) due to wide spreads and low liquidity.

### How much leverage should I use for gold trading?

Use 1:100 to 1:200 leverage for gold trading, even if your broker offers 1:500. Gold's high volatility (150-300 pip daily ranges) means excessive leverage can lead to rapid margin calls. Lower leverage with proper position sizing is much safer.

### Is gold trading more profitable than forex?

Gold trading can be more profitable than forex due to stronger, more sustained trends and higher volatility (150-300 pip daily ranges vs 50-80 for EUR/USD). However, it also carries higher risk and requires wider stops and better risk management.

### What is a good stop loss for gold trading?

A good stop loss for gold trading is 25-40 pips for scalping/day trading, 50-80 pips for swing trading, and 30-50 pips minimum during news events. Use technical levels (support/resistance) or ATR-based stops rather than arbitrary pip amounts.

Yes, TradeLocker is excellent for scalping gold due to fast execution (30-50ms with best brokers), one-click trading, tight spreads (0.2 pips with GatesFX/HeroFX), and no restrictions on scalping strategies. Best during London/NY overlap when spreads are tightest.

### Which prop firms allow gold trading on TradeLocker?

Major prop firms allowing gold trading on TradeLocker include FTMO, Funding Pips, PropElite, and TradeCapital. RestroFX is particularly well-suited for prop firm traders focusing on gold due to account structures aligned with challenge rules.

### How does gold correlate with the US dollar?

Gold typically has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar (DXY). When USD strengthens, gold usually falls, and vice versa. This correlation is strongest during risk-off events and Fed policy announcements. Monitor DXY for gold trading signals.

### What news events move gold prices?

Major news events that move gold include: Fed interest rate decisions (highest impact), US CPI/inflation data, NFP employment reports, geopolitical crises, Fed chair speeches, and US dollar strength/weakness. Gold can move $10-30 during these events.

### Is gold trading suitable for beginners?

Gold trading is challenging for complete beginners due to high volatility, wider spreads than major forex pairs, and need for quick decision-making. Beginners should start with demo accounts, trade during liquid hours only, use small position sizes (micro lots), and master risk management first.
