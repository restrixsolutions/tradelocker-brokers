### Broker vs Prop Firm
- **Brokers**: Traders use their own capital, brokers provide the trading platform and market access
- **Prop Firms**: Firms provide capital to traders, traders share profits, must pass evaluation challenges

### Important Trading Metrics

#### For Brokers:
- **Spreads**: Difference between bid/ask price (tighter is better)
- **ECN**: Electronic Communication Network - direct market access with raw spreads
- **Leverage**: Borrowing power (e.g., 1:500 means $1 controls $500)
- **Regulation**: Oversight by financial authorities (FCA, ASIC, CySEC)
- **Slippage**: Difference between expected and actual execution price

#### For Prop Firms:
- **Profit Split**: Percentage of profits trader keeps (70-90%)
- **Challenge Fee**: Cost to attempt funded account evaluation
- **Drawdown**: Maximum allowed loss (daily and total)
- **Challenge Types**:
  - 1-Step: One evaluation phase
  - 2-Step: Two evaluation phases
  - Instant: No evaluation needed
- **Scaling**: Ability to increase account size based on performance
