# Broker & Prop Firm Randomization Implementation

## Summary
Implemented randomization for the brokers and prop firms tables so that every time a user refreshes the page, the order changesâ€”except for featured items (like GatesFX), which always stay at the top.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/app/actions.ts`
Modified both `getFilteredBrokers()` and `getFilteredPropFirms()` functions:

- **When no sort field is specified**: The results are randomized using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- **Featured items always stay first**: Items with `is_featured: true` are separated and placed at the top
- **When a sort field is specified**: Normal sorting behavior applies (by name, minDeposit, yearEstablished, etc.)

**Key Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Separate featured and non-featured items
const featured = data.filter(b => b.is_featured)
const nonFeatured = data.filter(b => !b.is_featured)

// Shuffle non-featured items using Fisher-Yates algorithm
for (let i = nonFeatured.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
  const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
  [nonFeatured[i], nonFeatured[j]] = [nonFeatured[j], nonFeatured[i]]
}

// Return featured first, then randomized non-featured
return [...featured, ...nonFeatured]
```

### 2. Updated `/components/broker-table.tsx`
Modified the component to support null sort field:

- Changed `sortField` state type from `SortField` to `SortField | null`
- Default value is now `null` instead of `"name"`
- Updated URL parameter handling to properly remove `sortField` when not set
- Updated client-side sorting to maintain order when no sort field is specified

### 3. Database Verification
Confirmed via Supabase MCP server:

- **GatesFX** is the featured broker (`is_featured: true`)
- Current brokers in database:
  - GatesFX (featured)
  - Athens Markets
  - Clarity FX
  - HeroFX

## How It Works

### Initial Page Load (No Filters/Sorting)
1. User visits `/brokers` or `/prop-firms`
2. No `sortField` parameter is passed
3. Server fetches all items ordered by `is_featured DESC`
4. Featured items are separated from non-featured
5. Non-featured items are shuffled randomly
6. Featured items are placed first, followed by randomized items
7. Result is sent to the client

### On Page Refresh
1. Same process occurs server-side
2. New random order is generated each time
3. Featured items (GatesFX) stay at position 1

### When User Sorts
1. User clicks a column header (Name, Min Deposit, Year Established)
2. `sortField` parameter is set in URL
3. Normal database sorting applies
4. Featured items still appear first, then sorted items

### When User Clears Sort
1. URL parameter is removed
2. Page reverts to randomized state
3. Next refresh generates new random order

## Benefits

1. **Fair Visibility**: All non-featured brokers/prop firms get equal exposure over time
2. **Featured Priority**: GatesFX (or any featured brand) always stays at the top
3. **User Control**: Users can still sort by specific fields when needed
4. **SEO Friendly**: Server-side randomization ensures proper rendering
5. **Performance**: Efficient Fisher-Yates algorithm with O(n) complexity

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Visit `/brokers` or `/prop-firms`
2. Note the order of non-featured items
3. Refresh the page (Cmd+R)
4. Observe that:
   - GatesFX (featured) stays at position 1
   - Other brokers appear in a different order
5. Click a column header to sort
6. Observe traditional sorting behavior
7. Navigate away and return
8. Observe new random order again

## Technical Notes

- Uses server-side rendering (SSR) for proper randomization on each request
- Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm ensures uniform distribution
- No client-side state persists between page loads
- Build verified with no TypeScript or linting errors
