```tsx
// BEFORE
disallow: ['/*?*'] // ‚ùå Blocked /brokers?assetTypes=Forex

// AFTER  
disallow: [] // ‚úÖ Allows /brokers?assetTypes=Forex
```

**Impact:** Search engines can now index filtered comparison pages

// AFTER
{/* <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_CODE" /> */}
```

**Impact:** Removes confusing placeholder from HTML

### 4. ‚úÖ Added ItemList Schema Markup

**Issue:** Missing rich snippet opportunity for broker/prop firm listings

**Fixed:**

- Added to `/brokers` page (top 10 brokers)
- Added to `/prop-firms` page (top 10 prop firms)

```json
{
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Best TradeLocker Brokers 2025",
  "numberOfItems": 10,
  "itemListElement": [...]
}
```

**Impact:** Eligible for rich results (carousel, ranked lists)

- **/brokers:** Links to /prop-firms and /how-to-use
- **/prop-firms:** Links to /brokers and /how-to-use
- All links use keyword-rich anchor text

</p>
```

**Impact:** Better internal link equity distribution, improved user navigation

- Positioned as central hub/directory

**Impact:** Clear differentiation, better keyword targeting

### 9. ‚ö†Ô∏è OG Image (Temporary Solution)

**Issue:** Referenced `/og-image.png` doesn't exist

**Current Fix:**
- Created `/public/og-image.svg` as placeholder
- SVG includes branding, title, features, URL
- Dimensions: 1200x630 (correct ratio)

**Action Required:** 
- Create professional PNG version using Canva/Figma
- Instructions provided in `/public/CREATE_OG_IMAGE.md`
