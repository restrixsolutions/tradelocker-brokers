## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### About `/providers` Page:

**What It Shows:**
- 12 broker cards with logos
- Location (country)
- Year established
- Platform: "TradeLocker"
- Brief factual description

**What It Does NOT Show:**
- ❌ Affiliate "Get Started" buttons
- ❌ Spreads, fees, leverage
- ❌ Ratings or stars
- ❌ "Best" or "Featured" badges
- ❌ Comparison table with specs

**The Risk:**
Even though it's factual, Google might still flag it because:
- Shows multiple brokers (looks like directory)
- Your domain is "tradelockerbrokers.com"
- Rest of site has broker comparisons
- Algorithm might interpret as affiliate site

**But It Might Work Because:**
- No affiliate links on the page
- Purely factual information
- Educational framing
- Clear disclaimers
- Links to comparison tool (not direct affiliate)

- Landing: `/providers`
- Track: Approval rate, CTR, conversions

**Measure After 2 Weeks:**
- Which got approved?
- Which has better CTR?
- Which has better conversion?
- Which has better ROI?

**Then:**
- Scale the winner
- Pause the loser
- Iterate and optimize
